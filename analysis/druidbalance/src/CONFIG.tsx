      Hello Moonkins! This tool is intended to show major statistics and potential issues in your
      rotation. The Balance Druid analyzer is not yet fully updated for Shadowlands but the most
      important informations like DoT uptime, Eclipse usage and usage of the (most popular) Balance
      of All Things legendary should give you a quick overview about your performance.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you have any idea on what is missing, we would be happy if you let us know directly on
      Discord.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a rule of thumb: Keep up your DoT's, maximize the time you are in an eclipse and try to
      overcap as little Astral Power as possible. If you are using the{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BALANCE_OF_ALL_THINGS_SOLAR.id} />, always make sure to have atleast 90
      Astral Power when entering an Eclipse, so you make most out of it's crit buff by instantly
      casting three consecutive Starsurges <SpellLink id={SPELLS.STARSURGE_MOONKIN.id} />.
      <br />
